HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.


types ->

1. GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

2. POST
The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

3. PUT
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

4. DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.


When we use GET on form data the data filled is in the form of query string which are in the url,
but when we set the method to post the data will be stored by the browser not in the url


http is a client

now we use https because it is more secure and have more security over your important information
