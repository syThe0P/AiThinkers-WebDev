Ajax is just a method that allows web pages to be updated asynchronously data with a webserver behind the scenes.
this means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

now we use fetch method for that ->
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .catch(err => console.log(err))


earlier it was jquery we use for that
