Jquery is a library use to make javascript more easy to work with
because it make code easy to write than javascript and less bulky but the issue with this library is 
it is very imerative it means each function depend on another and on another so pyramid of doom happens
so for its solution react is introduced which makes javascript even more easy and fun and it is declarative.
